[SHORT DESC]        C Unit Testing Framework and Regression Tester
[DESCRIPTION]       A unit testing framework in C as well as a test utility that integrates into a project's existing makefile. It aims to make regression testing quick and easy by providing the fewest number of steps between editing and testing, and the easiest possible experience in adding new tests. It provides prefix-based, wildcard-based, and range-based searching for tests by name so that new code can be quickly and concisely tested with two shell commands (make, test).

[TITLE]             PFT
[SHORT DESC]        Unit Test Library for 42 ft_printf
[DESCRIPTION]       One of the early projects and a major barrier for many at 42 Silicon Valley is one which asks cadets to recode the libc printf, which is, for most, a daunting task in terms of size and complexity in the number of options they must simultaneously handle. I wrote a unit test library and regression tester for 42 cadets specific to this project. It contains, at present, 2409 unit tests, and is designed to be used in development, so that different pieces of the project can be tested individually. Like my more general C unit testing framework, it provides prefix-based, wildcard-based, and range-based searching for tests by name. Despite recent release, it is already becoming a popular tool for the project.

[SHORT DESC]        Recode of the libc printf
[DESCRIPTION]       One of the major early projects at 42, a recoding of the libc printf with at least the options %d, %i, %u, %s, %c, %p, %x, %X, %o, and at least the optional flags 0, ' ', +, -, #, hh, h, l, ll, L, precision, and field width. In mine I also included the arbitrary argument selector ($), unix terminal output formatting with colors and text decoration using keywords (eg %{green underline}), and added two additonal specifiers, %m and %b, to print a specified number of bytes of arbitrary memory space in hexadecimal or ascii (%m) or in binary (%b). I also implemented dprintf, sprintf, snprintf, asprintf, and added my own sbprintf (stringbuilder printf--this stringbuilder being part of my personal C library) as well as the variadic versions (v-) of each of these.

[TITLE]             GNLRollingBencher
[SHORT DESC]        Randomized Bench Tester for 42 get_next_line
[DESCRIPTION]       This is a tester for one of 42's early projects get_next_line. The project itself is to write a generalized readline function. The tester generates randomized input files of varying size, line length, content, and other characteristics, and compares an invocation of a validated function against the user's own function. Randomized testing is useful for this project because the project tends to involve hard-to-find edge cases that are implementation-dependent.

The tester makes use of a python script (not mine) that generates random valid input, and compares program output between a cadet's own fillit and various other validated fillit projects. Also included is a timing bencher that compares execution time between a cadet's own fillit and various other validated fillit projects.

It includes a basic interactive graphic visualization of the local neighborhood of the selected node. I created this for a particular game I've been working on for some time, and it is useful to store this game's tech tree as a database because the game is designed for a large and complex tech tree that could use a dbms's validation features to ensure integrity and consistency.

[DESCRIPTION]       I was part of an R&amp;D team creating an unmanned bicycle with the goal of getting an electric bicycle to follow a preprogrammed course. My major contributions were sensor filtering and data transfer protocols for downloading test data. The sensor filtering I accomplished with a kalman filter using a derivative-projection predictive model. I also developed automated optimization scripts that adjust the values of the process noise matrix to achieve optimal filter results. This was a special research project with CSU Chico Electrical Engineering department, led by Dr. Choi &#60;schoi13@csuchico.edu&#x3e;.

[SHORT DESC]        Revolving Stage
[DESCRIPTION]       I was helping a group build a new theatre space inside a historic building--the limitation with this being that we could not fix anything to existing supports. One feature the group wanted was a revolving stage--the video below shows progress as this feature was under construction.
