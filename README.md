# Online Website and Portfolio

This is my online website and portfolio, at [gavinfielder.com](http://gavinfielder.com).

I made this because I hate job hunting and everything associated with it. I hate customizing resumes and I especially hate customizing cover letters. I hope I never have to do another again.

To accomplish something close to this goal, I made a website that not only functions as an online resume and portfolio for potential employers to browse, but also lets me quickly make a custom resume and/or cover letter by letting me pick and choose what sections are shown on each.
